# Ockam node application

This Snowflake native application starts an [Ockam](http://ockam.io) node.
The node can be configured to open a encrypted, mutually authenticated portal to any system behind a private network.

You can for example use it to:

- Connect to private Postgres database as if it was colocated with your Snowflake application.
- Export some of your private Snowflake data to a partner system without opening any public endpoint on either side.
